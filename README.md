A simple Wordpress theme

This is my first attempt at building a Wordpress theme. I've started with simple, semantic html5 markup and no styles (other than the comments required in the style.css file it's empty)

Each function and tag used in the theme is documented and (sometimes) has links to where you can read more on the Codex.

I started working with just two files: index.php and style.css. These are the only two files you really need to get the theme to work once you have the right tags in them. Once I had the theme running I split the different parts into the more conventional header.php, sidebar.php, footer.php and then wrote some functions to get it to do the various things I think any base them should have. These include a menu location, a sidebar with widgets, and il8n support (Not fully supported yet).
